Rolls the 6 attribute scores for character creation, ensuring a total power of 70 is reached.

Simple program that i started as something to help me actually learn abit of C#
Windows Form Application - C#

Rolls 6 sets of dice, each set contains 4 x 6 sided dice.
The lowest die in each set is discarded.
The total of each set is calculated by adding together the three highest die.

The entire thing is looped and checked at the end.
If the 6 scores do not add up to at least 70 points, the dice are re-rolled until it does.
This ensures you wont have scores that are awful.

But can definately end up with scores that are on the high side.
